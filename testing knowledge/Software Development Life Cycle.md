# Software Development Life Cycle
------------------------

- The Software Development Life cycle or SDLC is a thorough process to manufacture software that systematically ensures that the quality and the correctness of the software is according to the standards set by the company and the industry


## Why use SDLC?
 ```
 SDLC is important to produce software.

    - It offers a basis for project planning, scheduling, and estimating
    - It is a mechanism for project tracking and control
    - Increased and enhance development speed
    - Helps you to decrease project risk and project management plan overhead
    - Provides a framework for a standard set of activities and deliverables
    - Increases visibility of project planning to all involved stakeholders of the development process
    -  Improved client relations

### Requirements Collections and Analysis
```
This stage is important also because it makes the following entities connected to the project, quite clear. They are:

 - Project Scope
 - Anticipated Opportunities
 - Anticipated Issues
 - Anticipated Directives
```

### Feasibility Study

```
Mainly there are 5 different feasibility checks that every project goes through.

 - Economic: Can this project be completed on the budget that the whole upper management and the stakeholders signed off on?
 - Schedule: Decide that the project can be completed within the given schedule or not
 - Legal: Can this project pass the cyber law requirements and other regulatory compliances?
 - Technical: Need to check whether the current computer system can support the software
 - Operation feasibility: Can we create operations that are expected by the client?
```
### Design

```
High-Level Design (HLD)
 - Brief description and name of each module
 - Interface relationship and dependencies between modules
 - Complete architecture diagrams along with technology details
 - An outline of the functionality of every module
 - Database tables identified along with their key elements
```
```
Low-Level Design (LLD)
 - Functional logic of the modules
 - Complete detail of the interface
 - Listing of error messages
 - Database tables, which include type and size
 - Addresses all types of dependency issues
 - Complete input and outputs for every module
```

### Coding
```
- In this phase, all of the developers roll their sleeves up and bunker own to code the entire system using the pre-selected programming language by the planning team.
```
### Testing
```
- This testing is performed, to verify that the entire application is working without any hiccups according to the requirements provided to the team by the customer.
```

### Installation
```
- The software in this deployment step is free of any bugs or issues and is finally released, based on the valuable feedback the team receives from the project manager.
```

### Maintenance
```
When that happens, the following three activities follow suit. They are as follows:

- Bug fixing – bugs are reported because of some scenarios which are not tested at all
- Enhancement – Adding some new features into the existing software
- Upgrade – Upgrading the application to the newer versions of the Software
```
