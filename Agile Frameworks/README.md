  - Agile is a flexible way to manage projects. It’s a set of values and principles designed to handle projects with changing requirements, and deliver value both early and frequently in a project's timeline.
  - There are several different frameworks used to apply Agile principles. To gain any level of success applying Agile to your project work, you need to have a confident understanding of Agile frameworks and the capability to apply those relevant to your business correctly.
  ```
## Scrum Framework - Focus: Team-led projects
  ```
  Scrum is perhaps the most popular Agile framework.
  It is a team-centric framework, utilising clearly defined team roles and responsibilities to implement the responsive style of Agile project management.
  ```

## Kanban - Focus: Streamlining workflow
  ```
  Kanban is similar to Scrum, in that it aims to support teams working at top-level efficiency together.
  It zooms in on the workflow aspect of a project, streamlining what is in progress and avoiding bottlenecks in productivity. Kanban usually involves use of a Kanban board or flowchart.
  ```

## XP - Focus: Value Delivery
  ```
  XP or Extreme Programming is popular in the software development sector due to its goal of frequent releases.
  This approach is ideal for projects where continuous value delivery is a high priority.
  ``` 


## FDD - Focus: Stakeholder Management
  ```
  Feature-Driven Development is not a million miles from XP. It also seeks to deliver value to clients regularly throughout the lifecycle of a project.

  This particular framework is client-centric, paying particular attention to stakeholder engagement.
  ``` 

## Crystal - Focus: Self-Managing Teams
  ```
  Crystal also dedicates a high level of focus to the project team, and places a lot of value on their ability to make key decisions on what's best for the project's success.

  It’s a great option for smaller teams who prefer a “lightweight” approach to their project work – less documentation, reporting and micro-management.
  ``` 

##  DSDM - Focus: Time & Budget Control
  ```
  DSDM stands for “Dynamic Systems Development Method”. Like XP and FDD respectively, it aims for regular value delivery and clear communication with stakeholders.

  DSDM concentrates on delivering the project goals on time and within budget.
  ```


# Which Agile Framework is Best?
  ```
  You may have already gathered from reading through the list that there is no "best framework". There is only what's best for your project team, and your project work.

   >>>  The great news is that you don't have to select just one framework. You can combine several to achieve the best-possible results for your project.
